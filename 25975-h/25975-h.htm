<h1><small>THE DELUGE IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENCE.</small></h1>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the Bible is God's book, we ought to know it.
If the Creator of the universe has spoken to man,
how important that we should listen to his voice and
obey his instructions! On the other hand, if the
Bible is not God's book, we ought to know it. Why
should we go through the world with a lie in our
right hand, dupes of the ignorant men who preceded
us? It can never be for our soul's benefit to cherish
a falsehood.</p>

<p>Science is, perhaps, the best test that we can apply
to decide the question. Science is really a knowledge
of what Nature has done, and is doing; and
since the upholders of the divinity of the Bible believe
that it proceeded from the Author of nature, if
their faith is true, it cannot possibly disagree with
what science teaches.</p>

<p>Science is a fiery furnace, that has consumed a
thousand delusions, and must consume all that remain.
We cast into it astrology and alchemy, and their ashes
barely remain to tell of their existence. Old notions
of the earth and heavens went in, and vanished as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
their dupes gazed upon them. Old religions, old
gods, have become as the incense that was burned
before their altars.</p>

<p>I purpose to try the Bible in its searching fire.
Fear not, my brother: it can but burn the straw and
stubble; if gold, it will shine as bright after the fiery
ordeal as before, and reflect as perfectly the image of
truth.</p>

<p>The Bible abounds with marvellous stories,&mdash;stories
that we should at once reject from their intrinsic improbability,
not to say impossibility, if we should find
them in any other book. But, among all the stories,
there is none that equals the account of the deluge,
as given in the sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters of
Genesis. It towers above the rest as Mount Washington
does above the New-England hills; and, as
travellers delight to climb the loftiest peaks, I suppose
that many would be pleased to examine this
lofty story, and see how the world of truth and
actuality looks from its summit.</p>

<p>According to the account, in less than two thousand
years after God had created all things, and pronounced
them very good, he became thoroughly
dissatisfied with every living thing, and determined
to destroy them with the earth. He thus expresses
himself: "I will destroy man, whom I have created,
from the face of the earth,&mdash;both man and beast, and
the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it
repenteth me that I have made them." Again he
says to Noah, "The end of all flesh is come before
me; for the earth is filled with violence through
them, and behold I will destroy them with the
earth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should the beasts, birds, and creeping things
be destroyed? What had the larks, the doves, and
the bob-o-links done? What had the squirrels and
the tortoises been guilty of, that they should be
destroyed?</p>

<p>He proceeds to inform Noah how he will do this:
"And behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters
upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the
breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing
that is in the earth shall die." And we are subsequently
informed that "every thing that was in the
dry land died." But why not every thing in the sea?
Were the dogs sinners, and the dog-fish saints? Had
the sheep been more guilty than the sharks? Had the
pigeons become utterly corrupt, and the pikes remained
perfectly innocent? It may be, that the
apparent impossibility of drowning them by a flood
suggested to the writer of the story the necessity of
saving them alive.</p>

<p>But Noah was righteous; and God determined to
save him and his family, eight persons, and by their
instrumentality to save alive animals sufficient to
stock the world again after its destruction.</p>

<p>To do this, Noah was commanded to build an ark,
three hundred cubits long, fifty broad, and thirty
high. It was to be made with three stories, and furnished
with one door, and one window a cubit wide.
Into this ark were to be taken two of every sort of
living thing, and of clean beasts and of birds seven of
every sort, male and female, and food sufficient for
them all.</p>

<p>There are differences of opinion about the length
of the cubit: most probably it was about eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
inches; but taking it at twenty-two inches, the largest
estimate that I believe theologians have made, the
ark was then five hundred and fifty feet long, ninety-one
feet eight inches broad, and fifty-five feet high.
Leaving space for the floors, which would need to be
very strong, each story was about seventeen feet
high; and the total cubical contents of the ark were
about one hundred and two thousand cubic yards.
Scott, in his commentary, makes it as small as sixty-nine
thousand one hundred and twenty yards; but the
necessity for room was not as well understood in his
day. Each floor of the ark contained five thousand
six hundred and one square yards, and the three
floors sixteen thousand eight hundred and three
square yards, the total standing-room of the ark.</p>

<p>Into this were to be taken fourteen of each kind of
fowl of the air or bird. How many kinds or species
of birds are there? When Adam Clarke wrote his
commentary, two thousand three hundred and seventy-two
species had been recognized. Ornithology
was then but in its infancy, and man's knowledge of
living forms was very limited. Lesson, according to
Hugh Miller, enumerates the birds at six thousand
two hundred and sixty-six species; Gray, in his
"Genera of Birds," estimates the number on the globe
at eight thousand. Let us not crowd Noah, but take
the six thousand two hundred and sixty-six species of
Lesson. Fourteen of each of these would give us eighty-seven
thousand seven hundred and twenty-four birds,&mdash;from
the humming-bird, the little flying jewel, to the
ostrich that fans the heated air of the desert,&mdash;or
over five for every yard of standing-room in the
ark. If spaces were left for the attendants to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
among them, to attend to the supply of their daily
wants, the birds alone would crowd the ark.</p>

<p>But, beside the birds, there were to be taken into
the ark two of every sort of unclean beast and fourteen
of every sort of clean beast. The most recent zo&ouml;logical
authorities enumerate two thousand and sixty-seven
species of mammals, or, as they are commonly
called, beasts. Of cetacea, or whale-like mammals,
sixty-five; ruminantia, or cud-chewers, one hundred and
seventy-seven; pachydermata, or thick-skinned mammals,
such as the horse, hog, and elephant, forty-one;
edentata, like the sloth and ant-eater, thirty-five;
rodentia, or gnawers, such as the rat, squirrel, and
beaver, six hundred and seventeen; carnivora, or
flesh-eaters, four hundred and forty-six; cheiroptera,
or bats, three hundred and twenty-eight; quadrumana,
or monkeys, two hundred and twenty-one; and
marsupialia, or pouched mammals, like the opossum
and kangaroo, one hundred and thirty-seven. If we
leave out the cetacea, that live in the water, and the
cud-chewers, which are the clean beasts, we have one
thousand eight hundred and twenty-five species; and
male and female of these, a total of three thousand
six hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>But, besides these, there were to be taken into the
ark fourteen of every kind of clean beast. And what
are clean beasts? The scriptural answer is, animals
that divide the hoof and chew the cud; and of these at
least one hundred and seventy-seven species are known.
Fourteen of each of these added, make a total of six
thousand one hundred and twenty-eight mammals,
from the mouse to the elephant. These beasts could not
be piled one upon another like cord-wood; they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
not be promiscuously crowded together. The sheep
would need careful protection from the lions, tigers,
and wolves; the elephant and other ponderous beasts
would require stalls of great thickness; much room
would be required to enable them to obtain needful
exercise, and for the attendants to supply them with
food and water; and a vessel of the size of the ark
would be taxed to provide for these beasts alone;
and to crowd in, and preserve alive, beasts and birds,
was an absolute impossibility.</p>

<p>But there are of reptiles six hundred and fifty-seven
species; and Noah was to take into the ark two of
every sort of creeping thing. Two hundred of these
reptiles are, however, aquatic: hence water would not
seriously affect them; but crocodiles, lizards, iguanas,
tree-frogs, horned frogs, thunder-snakes, chicken-snakes,
brittlesnakes, rattlesnakes, copperheads, asps,
cobras de capello, whose bite is certain death, and
a host of others, must be provided for. It would
not do to allow these disagreeable individuals to
crawl about the ark; and nine hundred and fourteen
of them would require considerable space, whether
they could obtain it or not.</p>

<p>By this time, the ark is doubly crowded; but its
living cargo is not yet completed. A dense cloud of
insects, and a vast army destitute of wings, make their
appearance, and clamor for admission. The number
of articulates that must have been provided for is
estimated at seven hundred and fifty thousand species,&mdash;from
the butterflies of Brazil, fourteen inches
from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other, to
the almost invisible gnat, that dances in the summer's
beam. Ants, beetles, flies, bugs, fleas, mosquitoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wasps, bees, moths, butterflies, spiders, scorpions,
grasshoppers, locusts, myriapods, canker-worms, wriggling,
crawling, creeping, flying, male and female,
here they come, and all must be provided for.</p>

<p>Nor are these the last. The air-breathing land-snails,
of which we know four thousand six hundred
species, could never have survived a twelve months'
soaking; and they must therefore be cared for. The
nine thousand two hundred of these add no little to
the discomfort of the trebly-crowded ark.</p>

<p>Now let the flood come: all are lodged in the ark
of safety, and are ready for a year's voyage. But we
forget: the ark has not yet received one-half of its
cargo. The command given unto Noah was, "Take
thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for
thee and for them;" and we are expressly told that
"according to all that God commanded Noah, so
did he."</p>

<p>Food for how long? The flood began in the "sixth
hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month." Noah, his family,
and the animals, went in seven days before this time,
and left the ark the six hundred and first year of
Noah's life, the second month, and the twenty-seventh
day of the month. They were therefore in the
ark for one year and seventeen days.</p>

<p>What a quantity of hay would be required, the
material most easily obtained! An elephant eats four
hundred pounds of hay in twenty-four hours. Since
there are two species of elephants, the African and
the Indian, there must have been four elephants in
the ark; and, supposing them to live upon hay, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would require three hundred tons. There are at
least seven species of the rhinoceros; and fourteen
of these, at seventy-five tons each, would consume no
less than one thousand and fifty tons. The two thousand
four hundred and seventy-eight clean beasts,&mdash;oxen,
elk, giraffes, camels, deer, antelope, sheep,
goats, with the horses, zebras, asses, hippopotami,
rodents, and marsupials&mdash;could not have required less
than four thousand five hundred tons; making a total
of five thousand eight hundred and fifty tons. A
ton of hay occupies about eighteen cubic yards; and
the quantity of hay required would fill a hundred
and five thousand three hundred cubic yards of space,
or more than the entire capacity of the ark.</p>

<p>If these animals were fed on other substances than
hay, the extra difficulty of obtaining and preserving
those substances would counterbalance any advantage
that might be gained by the economy of space.</p>

<p>A vast quantity of grain would be necessary for
thousands of birds, rodents, marsupials, and other
animals; and large granaries would be required for its
storage.</p>

<p>What flesh would be needed for the lions, tigers,
leopards, ounces, wild-cats, wolves, bears, hyenas,
jackals, dogs, and foxes, martens, weasels, eagles,
condors, vultures, buzzards, falcons, hawks, kites,
owls, as well as crocodiles and serpents! Not one
but would eat its weight in a month, and some much
more. A full-grown lion eats fifteen pounds of flesh
in a day: there are two species of lions; and the four
would eat twenty-two thousand pounds in a year.
There would be, at least, three thousand animals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
feeding upon flesh; and, if we calculate that they
averaged two pounds of flesh a day, this would
give a total of more than two million and a quarter
pounds of flesh to be stored up and distributed.
And since dried, salted, or smoked meat would not
answer, this flesh must have been taken into the ark
alive. It would be equal to more than thirty thousand
sheep at seventy-five pounds each; a great addition
to the original cargo, and necessitating an
extra quantity of hay for their food, till their turn
came to be eaten.</p>

<p>Fish would be required for the otters, minks, pelicans,
of which there are eight species, and must
therefore have been fifty-six individuals in the ark;
one hundred and five gulls, for there are fifteen
species; one hundred and twelve cormorants, forty-nine
gannets, one hundred and forty terns, two hundred
and eighty-seven kingfishers, beside storks,
herons, spoonbills, penguins, albatrosses, and a host
of others; mollusks for the oyster-catcher, turnstone,
and other birds.</p>

<p>The fish could not be preserved after death in any
way to answer for food, and must therefore have
been alive: large tanks for the purpose of keeping
them would take up considerable of the ark's space.
The water in such tanks would soon become unfitted
for the respiration of the fish, and there must have
been some provision, by air-pumps or otherwise, for
charging the water with the air essential to their
existence.</p>

<p>Many animals live upon insects; and this must
have been the most difficult part of the provision to
procure. There are nineteen species of goatsuckers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and there must have been in the ark two hundred
and sixty-six individuals. These birds feed upon
flies, moths, beetles, and other insects. What an innumerable
multitude must have been provided for the
goatsuckers alone! But there are a hundred and
thirty-seven species of fly-catchers; and Noah must
have had a fly-catcher family of nineteen hundred and
eighteen individuals to supply with appropriate food.
There are thirty-seven species of bee-eaters; and
there must have been five hundred and eighteen of
these birds to supply with bees. A very large
apiary would be required to supply their needs. But,
beside these, insects for swallows, swifts, martins,
shrikes, thrushes, orioles, sparrows, the beautiful
trogans and jacamars, moles, shrews, hedgehogs, and
a multitude of others, too numerous to mention, but
not too numerous to eat. Ants, also, for the ant-eaters
of America, the aard-vark of Africa, and the pangolin
of Asia. The great ant-eater of South America
is an animal sometimes measuring eight feet in
length. It lives exclusively on ants, which it procures
by tearing open their hills with its hooked
claws, and then drawing its long tongue, which is
covered with glutinous saliva, over the swarms
which rush out to defend their dwelling. Many
bushels of ants would be needed for the pair of ant-eaters
before the ark landed on Ararat. How were
all the insects caught, and kept for the use of all these
animals for more than a year? A hundred men could
not catch a sufficient number in six months. And, if
caught, how could they be preserved, together with
the original stock of insects necessary to supply the
world after the deluge? Some insects eat only bark;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
others, resinous secretions, the pith, solid wood,
leaves, sap in the veins, as the aphid, flowers, pollen,
and honey. Wood, bark, resin, and honey might
have been supplied; but how could green leaves, sap,
flowers and pollen, be furnished to those insects absolutely
requiring them for existence? Thirty species
of insects feed on the nettle, but not one of them
could live on dried nettles. R&ouml;sel calculates that
two hundred species subsist on the oak; but the oak
must be in a growing condition to supply them with
food. In no other way, then, could the insects have
been preserved alive than by large green-houses, the
heat so applied as to suit the plants of both temperate
and tropical climates, and the insects so distributed
among them, that each could obtain its
appropriate nourishment.</p>

<p>Fruit would be necessary for the four hundred and
forty-two monkeys, for the plantain-eaters, the fruit-pigeons
of the Spice Islands that feed on nutmegs,
for the toucans and the flocks of parrots, parroquets,
cockatoos, and other fruit-eating birds. As they did
not know how to can fruit in those days, and dried
fruit would be altogether unsuitable, there must have
been a large green-house for raising all manner of
fruit necessary for the frugivorous multitude.</p>

<p><i>How were the various animals obtained?</i> The command
given to Noah was, "Two of every sort shalt
thou <i>bring</i> into the ark."</p>

<p>Animals, as is now well known, belong to limited
centres, outside of which they are never found in a
natural state; and naturalists know that these centres
were established ages before the time when the
deluge is supposed to have occurred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Hugh Miller, in his "Testimony of the Rocks,"
says, "We now know that every great continent has
its own peculiar fauna; that the original centres of
distribution must have been, not one, but many;
further, that the areas or circles around these centres
must have been occupied by their pristine animals in
ages long anterior to that of the Noachian Deluge;
nay, that in even the latter geologic ages they were
preceded in them by animals of the same general
type. There are fourteen such areas, or provinces,
enumerated by the later naturalists;" and Cuvier,
quoted by Miller, says, "The great continents contain
species peculiar to each; insomuch, that whenever
large countries, of this description, have been discovered,
which their situation had kept isolated from the
rest of the world, the class of quadrupeds which they
contained has been found extremely different from
any that had existed elsewhere. Thus, when the Spaniards
first penetrated into South America, they did
not find a single species of quadruped the same as
any of Europe, Asia, or Africa."</p>

<p>The white bear is never found except in the arctic
regions; the great grizzly bear is only found in the
neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains. Nearly all
the species of mammals found in Australia are confined
to that country, as the wingless birds of New
Zealand are confined to that, and the sloth, armadillo,
and other animals, to South America.</p>

<p>A journey to the polar regions would be necessary
to obtain the white bear, the musk-ox, of which seven
would be required, since it is a clean beast; seven
reindeer, likewise; the white fox, the polar hare, the
lemming, and seven of each species of cormorant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gannet, penguin, petrel, and gull, some of which are
as large as eagles, as well as mergansers, geese, and
ducks, certain species of which are only found in the
frigid zone. Noah or his agents must have discovered
Greenland and North America thousands of
years before Columbus was born: they must have
preceded Behring, Parry, Ross, Kane, and Hayes in
exploring the Arctic regions. They searched the ice-floes
and numerous islands of the Arctic seas, snow-shoed,
over the frozen <i>tundras</i> of Siberia, to be certain
that no living thing escaped them; then, after
catching and caging all the animals, conveyed them,
with all manner of food necessary for their sustenance,
together with ice to temper the heat of the climate
to which they were for more than a year to be exposed,
returned to the nearest port, and, after a toilsome
journey from the sea-coast to Armenia, arrived
at their destination. How many of these animals
would survive the journey? and, of those that did,
how many would survive the change of climate and
habits?</p>

<p>Another party must have visited temperate America;
traversed New England in its length and breadth,
forded wide streams, made their way through unbroken
wildernesses, traversed the Great Lakes,
roamed over the Rocky Mountains, and secured the
black bear, cinnamon bear, wapiti or Canadian stag,
the moose, American deer, antelope, mountain sheep,
buffalo, opossum, rattlesnake, copperhead, and an
innumerable multitude of other animals&mdash;insects
birds, reptiles, and mammals, that are only to be found
in the temperate regions of America.</p>

<p>A voyage to South America must have been made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to obtain tapirs, pumas, peccaries, sloths, ant-eaters,
armadillos, fourteen each of the llama, alpaca, and vicuna,
beside monkeys, birds, and insects innumerable.
A vessel nearly as large as "The Great Eastern"
must have been employed, or a number of smaller
ones, to accommodate the collectors, the animals, and
food for a voyage across the Atlantic. There must
have been, at least, a thousand men, wandering
through the woods of Brazil, along the valley of the
Amazon, the Orinoco, and the La Plata; paddling up
the streams, scaling the mountains, roaming over the
pampas, climbing the tall trees, turning over every
stone and log, and exploring every nook, to discover
the snails, bugs, insects, worms, reptiles, and other
animals indigenous to South America, from the Isthmus
to Tierra-del-fuego.</p>

<p>There must have been obtained four elephants, for
there are two species, the Asiatic and the Indian;
fourteen rhinoceroses, one of which is found only in
South Africa, another in the island of Java, and a
third in Sumatra; two hippopotami, and possibly four,
for some authorities say there are two species. Fourteen
giraffes, since they are clean beasts, must have
been caught and driven from Central Africa (many
more, indeed, must have been caught, that the required
number might reach the ark and be preserved);
twenty-eight camels, two hundred and eighty oxen (for
there are twenty species, and they are clean); and no
less than thirteen hundred and eighty-six deer and antelope,
of which there are ninety-nine species recognized:
these to be collected in various parts of Europe,
Asia, Northern and Southern Africa, and America.</p>

<p>New Zealand must have been visited to obtain its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
wingless birds; Mauritius for its dodo, then living;
Australia for its marsupials and other peculiar animals;
and every large island, and most of the small
ones, to obtain those forms of life that are only to be
found in each. From the island of Celebes, they must
have taken the eighty species of birds that are confined
to it, which would require them to catch, cage, feed,
and convey eleven hundred and twenty specimens:
a no small job of itself. Ten men that could accomplish
that, and carry them safe to Armenia, would do
all that men could do in ten years. From the Philippine
Islands, the seventy-three species of hawks, parrots,
and pigeons, peculiar to them; which would require,
since fourteen of every kind of bird were to be
taken into the ark, no less than one thousand and
twenty-two specimens. From New Guinea, and the
neighboring islands, two hundred and fifty-two of the
magnificent birds of paradise, since there are eighteen
species.</p>

<p>A faint idea of the difficulties encountered and
overcome by Noah's agents may be gathered from
what Wallace, in his recent work on the Malay Archipelago,
informs us respecting these birds of paradise.
"Five voyages to different parts of the district they
inhabit, each occupying in its preparation and execution
the larger part of a year, produced me only five
species out of the fourteen known to exist in the New-Guinea
district." If it took Wallace, with all the assistance
that he had from various officials, five years to
obtain five species, represented by dead birds, how long
did it take Noah's agents to obtain eighteen species
represented by two hundred and fifty-two live birds?
Wallace could only obtain two alive, and for these he
had to pay five hundred dollars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>If the antediluvian sinners were any thing like the
modern ones, Noah must have been richer than the
Rothschilds, or he never could have obtained their
services; which he must have done, or it could never
be truthfully said, "according to all that God commanded
him, so did he."</p>

<p>The collection of the land-snails alone would be no
small tax. Seventy-four are peculiar to Great
Britain: hence there must have been a hundred and
forty-eight snails collected from that island. Six
hundred species are found in Southern Europe alone,
and twelve hundred must have been collected from
there; eighty in Sicily, ten in Corsica, two hundred
and sixty-four in the Madeira Islands, a hundred and
twenty in the Canary Islands, twenty-six in St.
Helena, sixty-three in Southern Africa, eighty-eight
in Madagascar, a hundred and twelve in Ceylon, a
hundred in New Zealand, and others on every large
and some of the small islands of the globe. The
world must have been circumnavigated many times
before the vessel of Magellan was built, and every
island visited and ransacked ages before the time of
Captain Cook. But it seems surprising, since these
voyages must have been performed by the sinful antediluvians,
that they did not save themselves in their
ships when the flood came; for vessels that could
perform such voyages would certainly have survived
the flood more readily than the clumsy ark.</p>

<p>But was it really done? A thousand men in ten
years, with all the appliances of modern art,&mdash;steamboats,
railroads, canals, coaches, and express companies,&mdash;could
not accomplish it in ten years; nor ten
times the number of men keep all the animals alive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one spot for one year, if they were collected together.</p>

<p>"But," says the Christian, "Noah never did collect
them: no intelligent person in this day ever supposes
that he did." What then? "The Bible expressly
declares that 'they went in unto Noah into
the ark.' By instinct, such as leads the swallow to
take its distant flight at the approach of winter, they
came from all parts of the globe to the ark of
safety."</p>

<p>It is true that one account does say that they came
in unto Noah, for there are two very different stories
of the deluge mixed up in those chapters of Genesis;
but, although flying birds might perform such a feat
as going twelve thousand miles to the ark, which
would be necessary for some, how could other animals
get there? It would be impossible even for
some birds. How could the ostriches of Africa, the
emus of Australia, and the rheas of South America,
get there,&mdash;birds that never fly? There are three
species of the rhea, or South-American ostrich; and
forty-two of these would have a journey of eight
thousand miles before them, by the shortest route:
but how could they cross the Atlantic? If they
went by land, they must have traversed the length of
the American continent, from Patagonia to Alaska,
crossed at Behring's Strait when it was frozen, and
then travelled diagonally across nearly the whole
continent of Asia to Armenia, after a journey that
must have required many months for its completion.
The sloths, that have been confined to South America
ever since the pliocene period at least, must have
taken the same route. How they crossed the mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
streams, and lived when passing over broad
prairies, it would be difficult to say. A mile a day
would be a rapid rate for these slow travellers, and it
would therefore require about forty years for them
to arrive at their destination. But, since the life of a
sloth is not as long as this, they must have bequeathed
their journey to their posterity, and they
to their descendants, born on the way, who must
have reached the ark before the door was closed.
The land-snails must have met with still greater
difficulties. Impelled by most wonderful instinct,
they commenced their journey full a thousand years
before the time; and their posterity of the five hundredth
generation must have made their appearance,
and been provided with a passage by the venerable
Noah.</p>

<p>Scott, who wrote a commentary on the Bible seventy
or eighty years ago, must have seen some of
these difficulties, though with nothing like the clearness
with which science enables us to see them now.
He says, "There must have been a very extraordinary
miracle wrought, perhaps by the ministration
of angels, in bringing two of every species to Noah,
and rendering them submissive to him and peaceable
with each other; yet it seems not to have made any
impression on the hardened spectators."</p>

<p>Think of a troop of angels fly-catching, snail-seeking,
and bug-hunting through all lands, lugging
through the air, horses, giraffes, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
and dropping them at the door of the ark.
One has crossed the Atlantic with rattlesnakes, copperheads,
and boas twined around him, almost crippling
his wings with their snaky folds; and another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with a brace of skunks, one under each wing, that
the renewed world may not lack the fragrance of the
old. What a subject for the pencil of a Raphael or
Dor&eacute;! Had the "hardened spectators" beheld such a
scene as this, Noah and his cargo would have been
cast out of the ark, and the sinners themselves, converted
by this stupendous miracle, would have taken
passage therein.</p>

<p>Not only must there have been a succession of most
stupendous miracles to get the animals to the ark, but
also to return them to their proper places of abode.
But few of them could have lived in the neighborhood
of Ararat, had they been left there. How could
the polar bear return to his home among the ice-bergs,
the sloths to the congenial forests of the New
World, and all the mammals, reptiles, insects, and
snails to their respective habitats, the homes of their
ancestors for ages innumerable? To return them
was just as necessary as to obtain them, and, though
less difficult, was equally impossible.</p>

<p><i>How could eight persons, all that were saved in the
ark, attend to all these animals!</i> Nearly all would
require food and water once a day, and many twice.
In a menagerie, one man takes care of four cages,&mdash;feeds,
cleans, and waters the animals. In the ark,
each person, women included, must have attended
each day to ten thousand nine hundred and sixty-four
birds, seven hundred and sixty-six beasts, one
hundred and fourteen reptiles, one thousand one hundred
and fifty land-snails, and one hundred and
eighty-seven thousand five hundred insects.</p>

<p>Few persons have an idea of the difficulty of keeping
even the common birds of a temperate climate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
alive in confinement for any length of time. Food
that is quite suitable in a wild state may be fatal to
them when they are kept in the house. Linnets feed
on winter rape-seed in the wild state, but soon die if
fed upon it in-doors. "They are to be fed," says
Bechstein, "on summer rape-seed, moistened in water;
and their food must be varied by the addition of
millet, radish, cabbage, lettuce and plantain-seeds,
and sometimes a few bruised melon-seeds or barberries."
Nightingales, he says, should be fed on meal,
worms, and fresh ants' eggs: but, if it is not possible
to get these, a mixture of hard egg, ox-heart minced,
and white bread may be given; but this often kills the
birds. No such food would do for Noah's nightingales,
then, or where would have been the nightingale's
song? They must have been fed on meal,
worms, and <i>fresh</i> ant's eggs. How they were obtained,
we have, of course, no knowledge. Bechstein
says that larks may be fed with "a paste made of
grated carrot, white bread soaked in water, and barley
or wheat meal, all worked together in a mortar.
In addition to this paste, larks should be supplied
with poppy-seed, bruised hemp, crumb of bread,
and plenty of greens, such as lettuce, endive, cabbage,
with a little lean meat or ant-eggs occasionally."
He says the cage should be furnished with a piece of
fresh turf, often renewed, and great attention should
be paid to cleanliness. The care of the birds in the
ark probably fell to the women. As they had not
read Bechstein, or any other author on bird-keeping,&mdash;and
thousands of the birds must have been total
strangers to them,&mdash;how did they know what diet to
supply them with, and where could they get it, supposing
they had time to supply them at all?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>If the difficulty was great to keep the birds of a
temperate climate, how much greater must it have
been to keep tropical birds in a climate altogether
unsuited to them? The two birds of paradise bought
by Wallace were fed, he says, on rice, bananas, and
cockroaches: of the last, he obtained several cans
from a bake-house at Malta, and thus got his paradise
birds, by good fortune, to England. But how many
cans of cockroaches would be necessary for two hundred
and fifty-two of such birds,&mdash;the number in
the ark? and where were the bake-houses from
which the supply might be obtained?</p>

<p>To keep this vast menagerie clean would have required
a large corps of efficient workers, especially
when we remember that there was but one door in
each story, as some suppose; or one door to the
whole ark, as the story seems to teach, and this door
was closed; and but one window, and that apparently
in the roof. The Augean stable, the cleansing of
which was one of the labors of Hercules, can but
faintly indicate what must have been the condition of
the ark in less than a month, supposing the animals
to subsist as long.</p>

<p><i>Whence came the water that covered the earth to the
tops of the highest mountains?</i> "All the high hills
that were under the whole heaven were covered.
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and
the mountains were covered," says the record. And
to do this, it rained for forty days and forty nights.
A fall of an inch of water in a day is considered a
very heavy rain in Great Britain. The heaviest single
rain recorded fell on the Khasia Hills in India,
and amounted to thirty inches in twenty-four hours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
If this deluging rain could have continued for forty
days and nights, and had it fallen over the entire surface
of the globe, the amount would only have been
one hundred feet; which, instead of covering the
mountains, would not have covered the hills. But,
of course, such a rain is only possible for a very
limited time, and on a small portion of the earth's
surface.</p>

<p>Sir John Leslie, in "The Encyclopedia Britannica,"
says, "Supposing the vast canopy of air, by some
sudden change of internal constitution, at once to
discharge its whole watery store, this precipitate
would form a sheet of scarcely five inches thick over
the surface of the globe." But if the water that covered
the earth above the tops of the highest mountains
came by rain, it must have rained seven
hundred feet a day for forty days! or there must
have fallen each day, according to Sir John Leslie's
estimate, more than fourteen hundred times as much
water on the earth as the atmosphere contained!</p>

<p>But the writer says, "The fountains of the great
deep were broken up." To the Jews, who supposed,
with David, that God had founded the earth upon the
seas, and established it upon the floods, this meant
something; but, in the light of geology, we see that
it only demonstrates the ignorance of the man who
wrote and the people that believed the story.</p>

<p>Adam Clarke, commenting on this passage, says,
"It appears that an immense quantity of water occupied
the centre of the antediluvian earth; and, as this
burst forth by the order of God, the circumambient
strata must sink in order to fill up the vacuum occasioned
by the elevated waters." If true, it would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
have assisted in drowning the world one spoonful.
For if the strata sank anywhere to fill the hollow previously
occupied by the water, it would only make
the mountains so much higher in comparison: hence
it would require just that much extra water to cover
them. In the light of geology, however, the notion
is sufficiently absurd. A mile and a half deep, the
earth's interior is hot enough to convert water into
steam; there is, therefore, no chance for water to
exist in its centre, or anywhere near it.</p>

<p><i>It is as great a difficulty to discover where the water
went when the flood was over.</i> We are told that the
fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven
were stopped, and the rain was restrained. But this
could do nothing towards diminishing the water. All
that it could possibly accomplish would be to prevent
the rise of the water. But we are also told that "God
made a wind to pass over the earth." All that the
wind could do, however, would be to convey to the
atmosphere the moisture it took up in vapor; and
this could not have lowered the water a yard. The
highest mountain, Kunchinginga, is more than twenty-eight
thousand feet high; the flood prevailed one
hundred and fifty days, and abated two hundred and
twenty-five; and if this abatement was done by the
wind, it must have blown an ocean of water from the
entire surface of the earth, one hundred and twenty-five
deep, every day for eight months! All the hurricanes
that ever blew, blowing at once, would be the
gentlest zephyr of a summer's eve, compared with
such a wind as that; and by what possibility could
such a craft as the ark survive the storm?</p>

<p>A question, proper to be asked is, <i>How were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
animals supplied with light?</i> and how did the attendants
see to wait upon them in the first and second stories
of the ark? There was but one window, and that
only twenty-two inches in size, and it appears to have
been in the third story. It was a day when kerosene
was unknown, and tallow dips were uninvented. How
did these animals live in the darkness? and, above all,
how did Noah and his family supply their wants? It
could have been no easy or pleasant thing to wait
upon hungry lions, tigers, crocodiles, and rattlesnakes
in the dark, to say nothing of the danger.</p>

<p><i>How did they breathe?</i> There was but one twenty-two
inch window; the ark was "pitched within and
without with pitch;" "The Lord shut him in." Talk
of the Black Hole of Calcutta: it must have been
pure as the breath of morning compared with the
condition of the ark in one day.</p>

<p><i>Where did they obtain water for drink?</i> Supposing
all the additional water needed to drown the world
was fresh, when mingled with the water of the sea,
as much as one-tenth of it would be salt water, and
this would render it utterly unfit for drink. Provision
must therefore have been made for water; and a
space certainly half as large as the ark must have
been taken up for the water necessary for this immense
multitude.</p>

<p><i>The fish, mollusks, crustaceans (such as our crabs and
lobsters), and all corals, must have died if such a flood
had taken place</i>,&mdash;the fresh-water fish from the salt
water at once added to their proper element, and
the salt-water fish and other marine forms from so
large an addition of fresh water. For months, there
could have been no shore: what is now the margin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the sea was buried miles deep; and all the fucoidal
vegetation, upon which myriads of animals subsist,
must have perished, and the animals with it, if the
change in the constitution of the water had not killed
them. Every time a man swallows an oyster, he has
evidence that the Noachian deluge did not take
place.</p>

<p><i>The plants must have perished also.</i> How many of
our trees, to say nothing of the grasses and feeble
plants, could endure a soaking of nearly twelve
months' duration? Some of the very hardiest seeds
might survive, but the number could not be large.
The present condition of vegetation upon the globe
is another evidence, then, that this deluge did not
take place.</p>

<p><i>When the ark landed on Mount Ararat, and the
animals went forth, how did they subsist?</i> As they
went down the mountains, the carnivorous animals
would have devoured a large portion of the herbivorous
animals saved in the ark. Beside the lions,
tigers, leopards, ounces, and other carnivorous mammals,
amounting to eight hundred and ninety-two, there
were in the ark six hundred and sixty-six eagles, for
there are forty-eight species; one hundred and forty-four
buzzards, fourteen hundred and forty-two falcons,
one hundred and forty hawks, two hundred and thirty-eight
vultures, and eight hundred and ninety six owls.
What chance would a few sheep, rabbits and squirrels,
rats and mice, doves and chickens, have, among
this ravenous multitude? How could the ants escape,
with ant-eaters, aard-varks and pangolins on the
watch for them as soon as they made their appearance?
There were as many dogs as hares, as many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cats as mice. How long a lease of life could the
sheep, hares, and mice, calculate upon? Before the
herbivorous animals had multiplied, so as to furnish
the carnivorous animals with food, they must all have
been destroyed, after all the pains taken for their preservation.
Noah should have given the herbivora, at
least a year's start, especially since the vegetation of
the globe was so deficient.</p>

<p>But we are told that the species of animals may
have been much fewer in the days of Noah; and,
therefore, much less room would be necessary. A
single pair of cats, say some, may have produced all
the animals of the cat kind; a pair of dogs, all the
animals that belong to the dog family. Such an explanation
might have been given when zo&ouml;logy was
little known, and geology had no existence; but there
is no place for it now. Animals change, it is true,
and all species have probably been produced from a
few originals; but the process by which this is accomplished
is so slow in its operation, that we have no
knowledge of the formation of a new species. We
know that lions, tigers, and cats of various species,
existed long before the time of the deluge, and dogs,
wolves and foxes; and we find mummied cats, dogs,
and other animals in Egypt, as old or older than the
deluge, so little changed from those of the present
time in the same locality, that we cannot recognize
any difference between them.</p>

<p><i>"You seem to forget that all things are possible with
God: he could have packed these animals into an ark
of one-half the size, brought them altogether in the
twinkling of an eye, and returned them as rapidly."</i></p>

<p>And you seem to forget that the account in Genesis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gives us no hint of any such miracle. Noah was
to take the animals to him, and to take unto him of all
food that is eaten; and, as Hugh Miller remarks,
"the expedient of having recourse to supposititious
miracle in order to get over a difficulty insurmountable
on every natural principle, is not of the nature of
an argument, but simply an evidence of the want of
it. Argument is at an end when supposititious miracle
is introduced." But, if a miracle was worked, it
was not one, but ten thousand of the most stupendous
miracles, and entirely unnecessary ones. This,
the Rev. Dr. Pye Smith saw, when he said, "We cannot
represent to ourselves the idea of all land animals
being brought into one small spot, from the polar
regions, the torrid zone, and all the other climates of
Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, Australia, and the
thousands of islands,&mdash;their preservation and provision,
and the final disposal of them,&mdash;without
bringing up the idea of miracles more stupendous
than any that are recorded in Scripture. The
great decisive miracle of Christianity,&mdash;the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus,&mdash;sinks down before it."</p>

<p>It is a favorite method with the advocates of special
revelations to show their agreement with the operations
of natural law, till a difficulty is met with that
cannot be answered, when they flee at once to miracle
to save them. But, in this case, miracle itself
cannot save them.</p>

<p>Geology furnishes us with evidence that no such
deluge has taken place. According to Hugh Miller,
"In various parts of the world, such as Auvergne in
Central France, and along the flanks of Etna, there are
cones of long-extinct or long-slumbering volcanoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which, though of at least triple the antiquity of the
Noachian deluge, and though composed of the ordinary
incoherent materials, exhibit no marks of denudation.
According to the calculations of Sir Charles
Lyell, no devastating flood could have passed over
the forest-zone of Etna during the last twelve thousand
years."</p>

<p>Arch&aelig;ology enters her protest equally against it.
We have abundance of Egyptian mummies, statues,
inscriptions, paintings, and other representations of
Egyptian life belonging to a much earlier period than
the deluge. With only such modifications as time
slowly introduced, we find the people, their language,
and their habits, continuing after that time, as they
had done for centuries before. Lepsius, writing from
the pyramids of Memphis, in 1843, says, "We are
still busy with structures, sculptures, and inscriptions,
which are to be classed, by means of the now
more accurately determined groups of kings, in an
epoch of highly flourishing civilization, as far back as
the fourth millennium before Christ." That is one thousand
six hundred and fifty-six years before the time
of the flood. Lyell says that "Chevalier Bunsen, in
his elaborate and philosophical work on ancient Egypt,
has satisfied not a few of the learned, by an appeal to
monumental inscriptions still extant, that the successive
dynasties of kings may be traced back without
a break, to Menes, and that the date of his reign
would correspond with the year 3,640 B.C.;" that is
nearly thirteen hundred years before the time of the
deluge. Strange that the whole world should have
been drowned and the Egyptians never knew it!</p>

<p>From the "Types of Mankind," we learn that the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is "asserted by Lepsius, and familiar to all Egyptologists,
that negro and other races already existed in
Northern Africa, on the Upper Nile, 2,300 years
B.C."</p>

<p>But this is only forty-eight years after the deluge.
What kind of a family had Noah? Was amalgamation
practised by any of Noah's sons? If all the
human occupants of the ark were Caucasians, how
did they produce negro races in forty-eight years?
The facts again compel us to announce the fabulous
character of this Genesical story of the deluge.</p>

<p><i>"No intelligent person now believes that it was a
total deluge: Buckland, Pye Smith, Miller, Hitchcock,
and all Christian geologists, agree that it was a partial
deluge, and the account can be so explained."</i></p>

<p>How strange that God should dictate an account of
the deluge that led everybody to a false conclusion
with regard to it, till science taught them a better.
But let us read what the account says, and see
whether it can be explained to signify a partial
deluge. To save the Bible from its inevitable fate,
such men as Buckland, Smith, Miller, Hitchcock, and
other Bible apologists, it is evident from their writings,
were ready to resort to any scheme, however
wild.</p>

<p>I read (Gen. vi. 7), "I will destroy both man and
beast, and the creeping thing." How could a partial
deluge accomplish this? (v. 13); "The end of all flesh
is come before me. I will destroy them with the
earth." How could all flesh be destroyed with the
earth by any other than a total deluge? (v. 17);
"I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy
all flesh wherein is the breath of life, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth
shall die." Not only is man to be destroyed, but all
flesh wherein is the breath of life, from under
heaven, and every thing in the earth is to die.
Can this be tortured to mean a partial deluge? (vii.
19); "And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon
the earth; and all the high hills that were under
the whole heaven were covered; and all flesh died
that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
cattle, and of beast, and of creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man. All in whose
nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
dry land, died. And every living substance was destroyed
which was upon the face of the ground, both
man and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the
earth, and Noah only remained alive, and they that
were with him in the ark." Had the man who wrote
this story been a lawyer, and had he known how
these would-be-Bible-believers, and at the same time
geologists, would seek to pervert his meaning, he
could not have more carefully worded his account.
It is not possible for any man to express the idea of a
total flood more definitely than this man has done.
He does not merely say the hills were covered, but
"<i>all</i>" the hills were covered; and lest you should
think that he certainly did not mean the most elevated,
he is careful to say "all the <i>high</i>" hills were covered;
and lest some one should say he only meant the hills
in that part of the country, he says expressly "all the
high hills that were <i>under the whole heaven were covered</i>."
He is even so cautious as to introduce the
phrase "<i>whole</i> heaven," lest some one in its absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
might still think that the deluge was a partial one.
To make its universality still more evident, he says,
"All flesh died that moved upon the earth." This
would have been sufficiently definite for most persons,
but not so for him; he particularizes so that none may
escape,&mdash;"both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast,
and of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,
and every man." To leave no possibility of mistake,
he adds, "all in whose nostrils was the breath of life,
of all that was in the dry land, died." Can any thing
more be needed? The writer seems to see that some
theological professor may even yet try to make this
mean a partial deluge; and he therefore says, "Every
living substance was destroyed which was upon the
face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the
creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; they
were destroyed from the earth." Is it possible to
add to the strength of this? He thinks it is; and he
therefore says, "Noah only remained alive, and they
that were with him in the ark." Could any truthful
man write this and then mean that less than a hundredth
part of the earth's surface was covered. If
not a total flood, why save the animals, above all the
birds? All that Noah and his family need to have
done would have been to move out of the region till
the storm was over. If a partial flood, how could the
ark have rested on the mountains of Ararat? Ararat
itself is seventeen thousand feet high, and it rises
from a plateau that is seven thousand feet above the
sea-level. A flood that enabled the ark to float on to
that mountain could not have been far from universal;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and, when such a flood is accounted for on
scientific principles, it will be just as easy to account
for a total flood.</p>

<p><i>"The flood was only intended to destroy man, and
therefore only covered those parts of the earth that
were occupied by him."</i></p>

<p>The Bible states, however,
that it was intended to destroy every thing wherein
was the breath of life; and your account and the Bible
account do not at all agree. But, if man was intended
to be destroyed, the flood must have been wide-spread.
We know that Africa was occupied before
that time, and had been for thousands of years, by
various races. We learn, from the recent discoveries
in the Swiss Lakes, that man was in Switzerland before
that time; in France, as Boucher's and Rigollet's
discoveries prove; in Great Britain, as the caves in
Devonshire show; in North America, as the fossil
human skull beneath Table Mountain demonstrates.
Hence, for the flood to destroy man alone at so recent
a period, it must have been as wide spread as the
earth.</p>

<p>Even according to the Bible account, the garden of
Eden, where man was first placed, was somewhere
near the Euphrates; and in sixteen hundred years
the race must have rambled over a large part of the
earth's surface. The highest mountains in the world,
the Himalayas, are within two thousand miles of the
Euphrates. That splendid country, India, would
have been occupied long before the time of the
deluge; and, on the flanks of the Himalayas, man
could have laughed at any flood that natural causes
could possibly produce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>"How do you account, then, for these traditions of
a deluge that we find all over the globe?"</i></p>

<p>Nothing more easy. In all times floods have occurred;
some by heavy and long-continued rains,
others by the bursting of lake-barriers or the irruption
of the sea; and wherever traditions of these
have been met with, men with the Bible story in their
minds have at once attributed their origin to the
Noachian deluge.</p>

<p><i>"But Jesus and the apostles indorse the account of
the deluge."</i></p>

<p>Granted; but does that transform a fable into a
fact? They believed the story just as our modern
theologians believe it; because they were taught it
when they were children, and had not learned better.
Jesus says (Matt. xxv. 37-39), "But as the days of Noe
were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
For, as in the days that were before the flood they
were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
and knew not until the flood came and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
If the man had regarded the story as false, he never
would have referred to it in such a manner. And, in
this manifestation of credulity on the part of Jesus,
we can see the very false estimate placed upon him
by so large a portion of the people of this country.
Let the truth be spoken, though Jesus and all other
idols be overthrown. So he would say, if alive, or
he was not as good and intelligent a man as I think
he was.</p>

<p>By this story the Bible stands or falls as a divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
book. It falls, as we see, and takes its place with
all other human fallible productions. For knowledge,
we go to Nature, our universal mother, who gives her
Bible to every soul, and preaches her everlasting
gospel to all people.</p>
